- Add capability to handle multiple vnf's to my view_sfs function. Currently only handles a single one.
- Add the ability to support arguments to specify yaml file and what needs to be viewed(Classifier, sfs, sffs, all)
- Troubleshoot viewSFFS code to make it work right in Jupyter
- Once viewSFFS working right in Jupyter add it to the python viewDnfvi.py tool




- Once the whole thing is working right add it to my environment variable path so I can use it without specifying the path
