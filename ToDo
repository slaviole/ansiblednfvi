1. Test createClassifiers using j2 file while still using arguments file
   to launch the playbook. This modularizes and I might even be able to
   have the create delete versions in one Jinja2 xml file. 

2. Test the use of path in playbook to specify where the ansible-playbook
   tool is located. This will save having to type "ansible-playbook" every
   time when launching a play

3. Look into aliasing to improve on command syntax to launch a playbook.
   Shoould be something like:
        ./createClassifiers.yml vyos_vars.yml
        # The above implies that the server information is still in the
        # vars file which may not be so bad if the syntax is cleaner.

4. Arrange Jinja2 templates and var files to that they can accomodate a
   flexible number of Classifiers, VNF's, and resultant service chain.
   This will require Jinja2 programmatic logic to loop through lists in
   the yaml file.
